Search Quality Automated
============================

-----------
Description
-----------
No matter how cool your search solution is, without a reliable way of testing it you will not be able to do any improvement and do not break something valuable. Searching visitors usually have more specific shopping intents, comparing to visitors who are simply browsing, so it is crucial to make sure search always works as expected. 

Even a tiny increase in search result quality might have a noticeable effect on conversion rate.
Naturally, you can use exit-rate to judge if your search needs improvements and do required adjustments, but will you be able to make sure those changes are safe? What if improved relevancy for a specific category breaks search for several other categories?

Moreover, high exit-rate means no matter what you are going to do, the problem has taken place, so dozens of customers already didnâ€™t manage to find what they were up to. Basically, the only way to proceed is to have a reliable search quality validation approach.

--------------------------------
Intent-based validation
--------------------------------
Clear intent makes search result validation way more simpler and straightforward. There are several validation strategies possible. The actual strategy implementation is out of scope of this project. 

Intent-based approach is pretty intuitive and straightfowrad. So, if you are searching for "fiskars splitting axe" you do not expect to see any other brands, any other tools etc. Obviously, chopping axe is definitely not an option, as well as any other type on an axe.
